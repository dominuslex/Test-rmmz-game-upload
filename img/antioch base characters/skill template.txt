Action Sequence - Plugin Commands
============================================================================

Skills and items, when used in battle, have a pre-determined series of
actions to display to the player as a means of representing what's going on
with the action. For some game devs, this may not be enough and they would
like to get more involved with the actions themselves.

Action Sequences, added through this plugin, enable this. To give a skill or
item a Custom Action Sequence, a couple of steps must be followed:

---

1. Insert the <Custom Action Sequence> notetag into the skill or item's
   notebox (or else this would not work as intended).
2. Give that skill/item a Common Event through the Effects box. The selected
   Common Event will contain all the Action Sequence data.
3. Create the Common Event with Action Sequence Plugin Commands and/or event
   commands to make the skill/item do what you want it to do.

---

The Plugin Commands added through the Battle Core plugin focus entirely on
Action Sequences. However, despite the fact that they're made for skills and
items, some of these Action Sequence Plugin Commands can still be used for
regular Troop events and Common Events.
